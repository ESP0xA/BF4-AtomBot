# BF4-AtomBot
My personal BF4 Hack

# Disclaimer
This source code is for educational purposes only. More specifically I released this code so that others have an easier time exploring how the frostbite game engine works. To ensure that this code is not misused all source code will be kept at least one patch level behind the current game. This means that if you were to clone this repo, and compile the hack that it would not work since each game patch requires reverse engineered classes and offsets to be updated. At no point was this code ever used during online play other than to test if it's functionality worked and that the engine features reversed were reversed correctly. I made this to learn low level reverse engineering, do not exploit that. I take no responsibility for how this is used, and will take action if i find out it is being mis-used.
